In my original plan, I wanted the soccer to only appear and move side to side, but what i changed is that I made the soccer ball spin, so it would look like its been dribbled. I was going to have the game be faster as the player continues to play the game, but I decided to implement a timer where would be a static flow for when the trophy and cone would slide, but they would do so in random ranges. In my original plan, I wanted the points to be gained based on how much time the player stays in the game, so the longer the more pointes, but I changed to trophy cup as a way to add points to the player. The reason why is because there are rounds for qualifying for the world cup. I was going to implement an audio for when the ball would swipe and make a wind or motion sound. However, because of the situation of the world cup, I wanted the crowd to be involved where I included their cheers for the game to be more motivational. The way that happens is when the soccer ball would dodge the cone and hit the trophy cup. This way the game would feel more exciting with the crowd included. In the end, I wanted to the atmosphere of the world cup to be involved in the game, which is why I made the changes accordingly, especially because the world cup would be held in Mexico, USA and Canada in 2026.
